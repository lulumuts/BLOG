  ## Description Personal blog is designed to restrict the posting of blog to the Visitor of the site. A visitor is simply allowed to view and comment on the posts. The Writer, who is the Administrator can add posts to the blog but can also delete and edit certain posts, if they click their username in the navigation bar.

  ## Setup/Installation Requirements

  You will need to install SQL Alchemy to use this application, as well as various other flask extensions that can be seen in the requirements.txt
  file. The one aspect that is not working as it should is the subscription form, and therefore the mail extension that is geared to send an update to the Visitor of the website, should they decide they want to subscribe.

  ## Technologies Used
  Python and Flask were used to create this application. Jinja was used extensively as well as Postgres for the storing of information.

  ## Support and contact details
  If you do have any questions do not hestitate to let me know on lulumutuli24@gmail.com.
